Bhavya Bajaj you mean alott to me like srysly I know I'll never find a better girl, keeping your hotness aside, the way you take meri care like a small kid is just mesmerizing like kese btaye kyu tujhko chahe yara bta na paye types hai tu. IDK why i love you but I just do. Even if tu meri gf ho na ho, I always want your presence in my life kyuki jitna pyaar meine tujhse itni jaldi kra vo shyd hi kisi aur ke sath same pace pr kar pau. Im sorry for every thing I have done to dissapoint you or make you angry, just know ke i will never leave you my love. I LOVE YOU

And that's good, too. So, they can say that you're high-maintenance, but it's OK because I like maintaining you."

                Happy Birthday to the amazing person who came into my life and made everything better! üéâüéÇ Today is all about you, and I‚Äôm so grateful for every moment we‚Äôve shared so far, and I can‚Äôt wait for all the memories we‚Äôll make in the future.

                Since the day we met, your laughter has been the happiest sound in my life, and your kindness has always made me feel safe and loved. As you start another year, I hope it‚Äôs the best one yet. Keep spreading your happiness and bright energy to everyone around you, just like you always do for me.
                
                Even though we‚Äôre not in the same place right now, I want you to know that my heart is always with you. I wish I could be there to celebrate with you in person, but no matter how far apart we are, my love for you is always strong.
                
                Here‚Äôs to you, to all your dreams, your hard work, and the amazing person you are. May this year bring you everything you‚Äôve wished for and more. Thank you for being you, and for letting me be a part of your life. Happy Birthday, my love! üéà‚ù§Ô∏è
